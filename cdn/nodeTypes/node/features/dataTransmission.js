Description:

The `DataTransmission` class handles the transmission of data chunks between peers. It provides methods for sending and receiving data chunks in a streaming fashion.

The class has the following methods:

- `constructor()`: This is the constructor of the `DataTransmission` class. Any required initialization logic can be added here.

- `sendChunk(peerNode, data)`: This method sends a data chunk to a peer node. It takes the identifier or address of the peer node as the first parameter and the data chunk to send as the second parameter. The implementation of this method should include the logic to send the chunk of streaming data to the `peerNode`. The example provided in the code simply logs a message indicating the chunk being sent.

- `receiveChunk(peerNode, data)`: This method receives a data chunk from a peer node. It takes the identifier or address of the peer node that sent the data chunk as the first parameter and the received data chunk as the second parameter. The implementation of this method should include the logic to handle the received chunk of streaming data from the `peerNode`. The example provided in the code simply logs a message indicating the chunk being received.

The `DataTransmission` class can be used to facilitate the transmission of data chunks between peers in a streaming fashion. It provides a basic structure for sending and receiving data, but the actual implementation of the data transmission logic would need to be added based on the specific requirements and protocols of the application.
